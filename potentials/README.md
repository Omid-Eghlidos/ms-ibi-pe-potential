##  Blended MS-IBI potentials for polyethylene

# File format
Each file is named PTYPE.WEIGHT.TABLE.ATYPES

where 
- PTYPE: gives the potential type (pair, bond or angle)
- WEIGHT: gives the crystalline weight factor
- ATYPE: gives the bead types (for PE these are all the same)

Note: all potential types (bond, angle, pair) should use the same
weights for a given simulation as they are trained together.
