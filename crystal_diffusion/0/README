To perform simulation for this weight do the followings:

1) Change the value of the following variables:

* Set variable weight to '0'

* Set variable T to the desired temperature

2) On a workstation/cluster without task scheduler, run:

mpiexec -n <N> <lammps_executable_path> -in in.lammps

* Where N is the number of available cores on a node.
